# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Develop a network-based intrusion detection system  using tools like Snort or Suricata. Set up rules and alerts  to identify and respond to suspicious network activity.  You can even visualize the detected attacks.

üõ°Ô∏è Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Dashboard
A sophisticated web-based Network Intrusion Detection System dashboard that provides real-time monitoring, threat detection visualization, and security analytics. This simulation dashboard mimics the functionality of enterprise-grade NIDS solutions like Snort and Suricata.
üåü Features
Real-time Monitoring

Live Alert Generation: Simulates real-time security alerts with varying severity levels
Threat Detection: Monitors for common attack patterns including DDoS, SQL injection, port scans, and brute force attempts
Traffic Analysis: Visualizes network traffic patterns with distinction between normal and suspicious activity

Interactive Dashboard

Status Overview: Real-time statistics showing total alerts, active threats, blocked IPs, and packets analyzed
Alert Management: Chronological display of security alerts with severity-based color coding
Network Topology: Visual representation of network infrastructure with threat indicators
Attack Analytics: Distribution charts showing attack types and frequency

Detection Rules Engine

Snort/Suricata Style Rules: Industry-standard detection rule format
Customizable Rules: Support for multiple detection patterns and thresholds
Rule Management: Easy viewing and updating of active detection rules

üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites

Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
No server installation required - runs entirely in the browser

Installation

Download the index.html file
Open it in any modern web browser
The dashboard will start automatically with live monitoring enabled

Alternative Setup
bash# Clone or download the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd nids-dashboard

# Open with a local server (optional)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then navigate to http://localhost:8000
üéØ Usage
Dashboard Controls

üî¥ Stop/Start Monitoring: Toggle real-time alert generation
üóëÔ∏è Clear Alerts: Reset all alerts and statistics
üì• Export Logs: Download alerts in CSV format for analysis
‚öôÔ∏è Update Rules: Refresh detection rules (simulation)

Understanding Alerts
Alerts are color-coded by severity:

üî¥ High (Red): Critical threats requiring immediate attention
üü° Medium (Orange): Moderate threats requiring investigation
üü¢ Low (Green): Minor anomalies for awareness

Attack Types Monitored

Port Scan: Network reconnaissance attempts
DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service attacks
SQL Injection: Database attack attempts
Malware: Malicious software detection
Brute Force: Authentication attack attempts
Suspicious Traffic: Anomalous network behavior

üîß Technical Details
Architecture

Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
Visualization: Chart.js for interactive charts and graphs
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly interface with CSS Grid and Flexbox
Real-time Updates: JavaScript-based simulation engine

Detection Rules Format
The system uses Snort/Suricata compatible rule syntax:
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"SSH Brute Force Attempt"; flow:to_server; content:"SSH"; threshold:type both,track by_src,count 5,seconds 60; sid:1001;)
Data Export
Alerts can be exported in CSV format containing:

Timestamp
Attack type
Severity level
Source IP address

üìä Dashboard Components
Status Bar

Total Alerts: Cumulative count of all detected threats
Active Threats: Currently active high-severity threats
Blocked IPs: Number of IP addresses blocked due to malicious activity
Packets Analyzed: Real-time packet processing counter

Charts and Visualizations

Attack Types Distribution: Doughnut chart showing attack frequency by type
Traffic Analysis: Line chart comparing normal vs. suspicious traffic over time
Network Topology: Interactive network map with threat indicators
Alert Timeline: Chronological list of recent security events

üõ†Ô∏è Customization
Adding New Attack Types
javascriptthis.attackTypes = {
    'Port Scan': 0,
    'DDoS': 0,
    'SQL Injection': 0,
    'Malware': 0,
    'Brute Force': 0,
    'Suspicious Traffic': 0,
    'New Attack Type': 0  // Add here
};
Modifying Detection Rules
Edit the rules array in the NetworkIDS class:
javascript{
    id: 6,
    rule: 'alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 443 (msg:"SSL/TLS Anomaly"; content:"TLS"; sid:1006;)',
    description: 'Detects SSL/TLS protocol anomalies'
}
Styling Customization
The CSS uses CSS custom properties for easy theme modification:

Modify gradient backgrounds in the body selector
Adjust transparency levels in .panel and .status-item classes
Change alert colors in .alert-high, .alert-medium, .alert-low classes

üîí Security Considerations
This is a simulation dashboard for educational and demonstration purposes. For production use:

Implement proper authentication and authorization
Add input validation and sanitization
Use HTTPS for secure communication
Integrate with real NIDS engines (Snort, Suricata, etc.)
Implement proper logging and audit trails

üåê Browser Compatibility
